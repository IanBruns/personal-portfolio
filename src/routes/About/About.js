            <p>
                Before becoming a developer, I worked in client-service industry jobs and found
                myself wanting a little bit more.  In the 2020 quarantine, I bought myself an
                intro to coding book (I still keep it by my nightstand for good luck), and found myself
                absorbed in that material.  With that passion and some prior history in dev from high school
                and college, I made the plunge into Thinkful's Engineering Immersion program.  I'm
                glad I did as I now get to work in a field I'm deeply passionate about
            </p>

            <p>
                Now I'm excited to work with a team of passionate developers working on problem solving
                and creating clean and well tested code

                When not developing, you can usually find me spending time with friends, or listening to
                music (if you ask me to share with you what I'm listening to, prepare for an onslaught of
                good stuff).
