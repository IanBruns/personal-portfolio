            <div className="item">
                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Ian Bruns, and I am a student developer currently living in Denver, CO.
                </p>
                <hr />
                <p>
                    I took up programming as a hobby in work from home/quarantine, and found myself absorbed in the
                    subject
                    material. I then signed up for the software engineering program through Thinkful! because I want to
                    make
                    this a career, not just a hobby. If you want someone who is passionate about the subject material,
                    you
                    will find that in me
                    </p>
                <hr />
                <p>
                    When not programming, you can usually find me spending time with friends and loved ones, working
                    out,
                    and honing a ping pong skill that I developed working in payroll for a major corporation. I'm also a
                    pop
                    culture trivia library, and can sit down and talk to you about music at all times in the day until
                    I am
                    blue in the face
                    </p>
                <hr />
                <p>
                    So stick around, pull up a chair, and if you like what you see and want to get to know more, please
                    do
                    not hesitate to reach out!
